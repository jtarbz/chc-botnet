# chc-botnet
This is a botnet that coordinates the scraping of the Calvert Hall College High School website in order to check for snowdays
or other important announcements.

This version, written entirely in pure C, is intended to be a more portable and functional alternative to the original botnet,
written in JavaScript, which can be found [here](https://github.com/SpencerJ21/scraperBrokerServer).
